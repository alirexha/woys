## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project scaffold: directory layout, MIT license with upstream attribution, README placeholder, progress tracking.
- `pyproject.toml` (hatchling, ruff, mypy strict, pytest), `.python-version` 3.11, isolated `uv` venv.
- `src/vcclient_cachy/cli.py` — `vcclient-cachy info` prints CUDA/PipeWire/Python versions.
- `tests/test_environment.py` (4/4 passing on host).
- `docs/00-recon.md` — 813-line reconnaissance of upstream `w-okada/voice-changer`. Identified hot path (9 files), 8 non-RVC engines for removal, ~22k LOC reduction target, and proposed `src/server/` layout for Phase 1.

### Discovered (Phase 0 highlights)
- `OnnxContentvec` is a stub upstream — every "ONNX RVC" run silently uses PyTorch+fairseq for the embedder. Phase 1 keeps PyTorch as a hard dep; ONNX-only embedder is a future optimization.
- Upstream `requirements.txt` is missing `fairseq` and `pyworld` — they ship via Docker, not pip. Will add to fork.
- `onnxruntime-gpu==1.13.1` and `torch==2.0.1` are mid-2022 vintage; bumping to ORT 1.20+ and torch ≥ 2.4 (CUDA 12 wheels) for driver 595 forward-compat.
